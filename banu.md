Banu is an alien race and culture in the fictive sc-fi universe of the game Star Citizen.

They have a unique culture centered around trade and soulis, a form of family mixed with corporation. 
Most importantly for this bot, a language was created for them.
Me and some friends are learning this language for roleplaying purpose, and this bot helps to talk like them on discord.


## How does the language works ?
The banu does not record history, and there language is mainly oral. Still, there is two ways of writing Banu ;

-- Standard Romanized Banu (SRB) : .onjeko ochoae.    This is a way of writing Banu with latins letters, writing how it sounds like.

-- Ochoas : Ochoas are the letters of the Banu alphabet, and the normal way of writing Banu. (think writing chinese vs writing the pronunciation)
It looks like this ; https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/19339-Transmission-From-The-Banu-Protectorate


## So, what is this bot ?
This bot take a message in SRB and translate it with an image and custom fonts in ochoas, so a conversation in discord can be made as if we were Banus.


## I don't speak Banu ! How can I test the bot ?
Don't worry, there is an official document with a lot of english/srb/ochoa exemple, with all the quirks of the langage.

You could try the bot with the exemples given
But 200 pages is a lot, so here's some quick sentences you can try ; 

            .eto choa zo uBanu.     : I write like a Banu.
            ¿iino nja yufu zo uBanu?    : Can you speak like a Banu ?
            .tanya inya fo indo.    : Luck be with us.
            .eto fo gongo onesu. ¿Onjeko yatsa endéa?   : I have a lot of credits. How much does this cost ?


Or you could take some weeks to learn it, who knows.
¡tanya inya nyo nyo ino, kanda wani Banu zo ktafi ke yaya!
